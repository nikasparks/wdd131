        <h2>Mosiah 8:20</h2>
        <p>
          20 O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth he
          suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and impenetrable are the
          understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom,
          neither do they desire that she should rule over them!

        <h2>3 Nephi 9:15</h2>
        <p>
          15 Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and
          the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from
          the beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me
          hath the Father glorified his name.
